# Description

Blender was used to make 3D models. Three.js & react-three-fiber with @react-three/drei library were used to integrate and animate models. The result is a responsive, interactive 3D representation of Arizona where users can manipulate the scene by clicking on counties and toggling contextual overlays. It's just a learning project for 3D modeling and associated frontend development, particularly with react, three.js, and supporting libraries.
