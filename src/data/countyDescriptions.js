                        most populous county of Arizona</a>, with Phoenix as its seat of county and state governance.
                        Rather than a megalopolis that is now the <a a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/06/11/phoenix-nation-5th-largest-but-real-city/369917001/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">
                        5th largest city in the U.S.</a>, the greater Phoenix area is best described 
                        as a mega-suburb where official city boundaries are, to the average person, useless. Surprise is 
                        Glendale is Chandler is Mesa. If you’re from the mega-burb, you’re from Phoenix, no questions asked,

                        Along with La Paz county, Mohave county benefits from Parker Dam, but indirectly through Havasu Lake. <a href="https://www.havasuchamber.com/community-profile.html" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">

                    <p>
                        The lakes and watersport are a secondary benefit, as Parker Dam was bulit to service agriculture, with senior water rights held by local tribes that have recently agreed to sell them
                        back to areas that need them most (see further reading). Those tribes were the first to irrigate the parched dirt made fertile by its past as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology_in_Arizona" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">
                        a shallow sea</a>. The land is productive,
                        but those tribes depend on Parker Dam, so its waters must remain level, meaning that Lake Havasu is always filled to the brim, unlike reservoirs much farther upstream.
